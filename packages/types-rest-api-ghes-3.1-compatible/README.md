> Types for GHES 3.1 (compatible) REST API requests and responses

üö´‚ö†Ô∏è This package is part of an experimental Octokit SDK for testing purpose only - DO NOT USE

The goal for this package is to enable developers to build code that will work in both environments: github.com and GHES 3.1. Only endpoints and properties that exist in both have types by default.

The version can be overwritten on a per-request basis as needed.

## Usage

```ts
const octokit = new Octokit({
  version: "ghes-3.1-compatible",
});
const response = await octokit.request("GET /");
```

The routes suggested for `octokit.request(route)` are only the ones that exist for `version: "github.com"` and have no overrides for `version: "ghes-3.1"`. The same is true for `response.headers`.

To override the version specified in the constructor it can be set using the `request.version` option

```ts
const ghesOnlyResponse = await octokit.request("GET /admins/users", {
  request: {
    version: "ghes-3.1",
  },
});
```
